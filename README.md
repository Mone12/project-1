# Project description
Web app that will allow user to schedule their day. User will put in date, location, and app will ask user what they like/want to do to pick activities and meals for the day. App will use various APIs (Yelp, Ticketmaster, Google Maps, Eventbrite, Meetup) to find things to do. App will schedule the entire day and provide directions from place to place.

Users can save their day, and share with other users, other users can comment?

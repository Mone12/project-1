# Netflix & Chill 
Very first project I created within a group during boot camp. We were all, for the most part fairly, new at coding 
so it could use some more work. However, it's completely functional so feel free to check it out in the link above.

## Project description
Visit Here: https://mone12.github.io/project-1/
 
Web app that will allow user to get recommendations for a netflix show/movie and a type of drink so they can "netflix and chill."

User will be able to pick a type of movie/show and get suggestions

User will be able to get a drink suggestion as well. If they are under 21 or don't drink alcohol, they will get a non-alcoholic drink suggestion.

If they are 21 and want to drink, they will get an alcoholic drink suggestion based on a type of alcohol/ingredient.
